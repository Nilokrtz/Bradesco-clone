# Bradesco-clone

Allow me to present my debut project, which I skillfully developed during my tenure as an esteemed IT technician at Senac RJ. The culmination of this endeavor is a meticulously crafted cloned website of Bradesco, signifying a remarkable achievement in my early journey into the world of coding.

As with any first coding project, I humbly acknowledge that the code may not boast the utmost refinement. Nonetheless, it serves as a testament to my unwavering commitment to personal growth and professional development. Embracing this opportunity to record my progress.
